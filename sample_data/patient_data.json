Requesting evaluation for adjunctive pharmacotherapy.\n\n---\n\n**History of Present Illness:**  \nMr. Reed presents for an initial consultation regarding weight management. He reports a lifelong struggle with obesity, with weight steadily increasing over the last 15 years. He has tried multiple diets (including calorie restriction and low-carbohydrate regimens), as well as several attempts at increasing physical activity, most recently working with a dietitian and joining a gym in January 2025. He reports some short-term weight loss with these interventions (up to 12 lbs), but has not achieved or maintained significant long-term results. He experiences fatigue with exertion and intermittent knee pain, likely exacerbated by his weight. No history of previous anti-obesity medication use; no bariatric surgery.\n\n---\n\n**Relevant Medical History:**  \n- Obesity (BMI >35 with comorbidities)  \n- Hypertension, diagnosed 2017, well controlled on lisinopril 20 mg daily  \n- Dyslipidemia, diagnosed 2019, on atorvastatin 20 mg daily  \n- Family history: father with type 2 diabetes mellitus  \n- No history of type 2 diabetes (last HbA1c 5.7% in May 2025)  \n- No significant cardiac, hepatic, or renal disease  \n- Allergies: NKDA\n\n---\n\n**Physical Examination:**  \n- **General:** Alert, well-appearing male in no acute distress  \n- **HEENT:** No thyromegaly, normal oropharynx  \n- **Neck:** Supple, no lymphadenopathy  \n- **Cardiac:** Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs  \n- **Lungs:** Clear to auscultation bilaterally  \n- **Abdomen:** Soft, non-tender, no hepatosplenomegaly  \n- **Extremities:** No edema, normal pulses  \n- **Musculoskeletal:** Mild crepitus in right knee, full range of motion  \n- **Skin:** No rashes or acanthosis nigricans\n\n---\n\n**Assessment:**  \nIsaiah is a 55-year-old male with class II obesity (BMI 37.4 kg/m²), hypertension, and dyslipidemia. He has made multiple physician-documented weight loss attempts through diet and exercise, with insufficient sustained weight reduction. He does not have diabetes but is at elevated risk given family history. His BMI and comorbid conditions meet the criteria for anti-obesity pharmacotherapy.\n\nHe expresses high motivation to continue lifestyle interventions as recommended, and would benefit from adjunctive pharmacologic therapy to improve weight-related outcomes and reduce risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\n---\n\n**Plan:**  \n1. **Initiate Zepbound (tirzepatide) 10 mg:**  \n   - Instructed to administer subcutaneously once weekly  \n   - Educated about proper injection technique  \n2. **Continue current antihypertensive and statin therapy**  \n3. **Lifestyle counseling:**  \n   - Reinforce adherence to a reduced-calorie, balanced diet  \n   - Encourage at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity per week  \n   - Will provide referral to registered dietitian for additional support  \n4. **Monitor for side effects:**  \n   - Discussed possible adverse effects of Zepbound including gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation), and less common risks such as pancreatitis or cholelithiasis  \n   - Instructed to report any persistent abdominal pain, severe vomiting, or other serious symptoms immediately  \n5. **Laboratory assessment:**  \n   - Ordered baseline CMP, fasting glucose, and HbA1c  \n   - Lipid panel to monitor for dyslipidemia  \n6. **Follow-up:**  \n   - Return visit in 6 weeks for assessment of tolerance, review of labs, and interval weight check  \n   - Will reassess dosing, review adherence, and consider escalation if well tolerated and indicated\n\nPatient expressed understanding of risks and benefits, and verbalized willingness to proceed with Zepbound in conjunction with ongoing lifestyle changes.

She reports a 6-year history of psoriasis with progressive involvement of the scalp, elbows, upper back, and knees. Current symptoms include pruritus, flaking, and intermittent erythematous plaques, which are increasingly difficult to manage with topical agents alone. She also endorses negative psychosocial impact, including self-consciousness about skin appearance. No joint involvement reported.  \n\nPrevious treatments have included medium- and high-potency topical corticosteroids, topical vitamin D analogues, and a short course of phototherapy last year. These have provided only partial and temporary relief.  \n\nNo history of previous systemic immunosuppressive therapy or biologics.  \n\n---\n\n**Relevant Past Medical History:**  \n- Plaque psoriasis, moderate-to-severe (diagnosed age 19)  \n- No known psoriatic arthritis  \n- Mild seasonal allergies  \n- Up to date on vaccinations (including hepatitis B and pneumococcal)  \n- No history of tuberculosis or chronic infections  \n- No personal or family history of inflammatory bowel disease  \n- No significant medication allergies  \n\n---\n\n**Physical Examination:**  \n- General: Well-appearing, alert, cooperative  \n- Skin: Raised, erythematous, well-demarcated plaques with silvery scale on extensor surfaces of both elbows, anterior knees, and scattered lesions on the scalp and posterior trunk—estimated BSA involvement ~10%. Evidence of chronicity but no active infection or ulceration.  \n- Nails: No pitting or onycholysis  \n- Joints: No tenderness, warmth, swelling, or limitation of range of motion  \n- Cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal: Normal  \n- Lymphadenopathy: None detected  \n\n---\n\n**Assessment:**  \n25-year-old woman with a 6-year history of moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis involving >10% BSA, who has demonstrated inadequate response to topical therapy and phototherapy. She has no current or previous evidence of psoriatic arthritis or other inflammatory arthropathies. No contraindications to biologic therapy identified on review of systems or medical history, including no history of TB, chronic infections, demyelinating disorders, or malignancy. Up to date on immunizations and appropriate screening labs.  \n\nMs. Andrews meets criteria for initiation of Skyrizi (risankizumab-rzaa) due to significant disease burden, documented failure of prior first-line therapies, and significant impact on quality of life.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan:**  \n\n1. **Medication Initiation**:  \n   - Start Skyrizi 150 mg subcutaneously at week 0, repeat at week 4, then every 12 weeks thereafter pending efficacy and tolerance.  \n   - Patient educated on SQ injection technique.  \n   - Discussed mechanism of action (IL-23 inhibitor) and potential AEs, including increased risk of upper respiratory tract infections, headache, injection site reactions, and theoretical risk of TB reactivation.  \n\n2. **Baseline Screening:**\n   - TB screening completed: Quantiferon Gold negative (2025-08-10).\n   - Hepatitis B and C screening negative (2025-08-10).\n   - Labs: CBC, LFTs, renal function all within normal limits.\n   - Up to date on age-appropriate cervical and breast cancer screenings.\n\n3. **Lifestyle/Adjunctive Measures:**  \n   - Continue gentle skin care and topical corticosteroids for focal flares.\n   - Reinforced importance of moisturization and avoidance of known triggers (e.g., stress, skin trauma).\n   - Patient encouraged to continue balanced diet and regular exercise, as discussed.\n\n4. **Patient Education & Counseling:**  \n   - Provided Skyrizi medication guide, discussed logistics of prior authorization and support programs.\n   - Addressed need to report any signs of infection or new neurological symptoms immediately.\n   - Advised against live vaccines during treatment course.\n   - Confirmed negative pregnancy status and discussed use of effective contraception during therapy.\n\n5. **Follow-Up:**  \n   - Schedule follow-up visit in 4 weeks for next dose and to monitor response/tolerability.\n   - Laboratory monitoring and clinical assessment at each visit; review BSA involvement and adverse effects.\n   - Provide 24/7 contact info for urgent concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nMichelle Andrews is an appropriate candidate for Skyrizi therapy as outlined above. Biologic therapy is medically necessary given failure of less intensive treatments, BSA involvement, and diminished quality of life.  \nShe understands the benefits, potential side effects, and monitoring plan, and agrees to proceed with therapy.\n\n**Provider signature & credentials**  \n[insert provider name, MD/DO/NP/PA]  \n[practice name/contact information]  \n**Date:** 2025-08-17",

Occasional mild nausea after injections persists but is manageable and transient.\n\n---\n\n**Medical History:**  \n- Obesity (diagnosed in 2023)  \n- Hypertension (diagnosed 2022, well-controlled with lisinopril 20 mg daily)  \n- Dyslipidemia (mild, managed with lifestyle modification - no current pharmacotherapy)  \n- No history of diabetes mellitus  \n- Family history of type 2 diabetes (father)  \n\n**Previous Weight Management Efforts:**  \nPatient previously trialed structured diet and exercise programs for 12 months prior to medication initiation with modest but unsustained weight loss.\n\n---\n\n**Vital Signs:**  \n- Height: 5’11” (180 cm)  \n- Weight (today): 272 lbs (123.3 kg)  \n- BMI: 38.1 kg/m² (previous BMI at 14 months prior: 43.9 kg/m², 313 lbs)  \n- BP: 126/78 mmHg  \n- HR: 74 bpm\n\n---\n\n**Physical Examination:**  \n- General: Well-appearing, pleasant male in no distress  \n- HEENT: Mucous membranes moist, no oropharyngeal lesions  \n- Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs  \n- Pulmonary: Clear to auscultation bilaterally  \n- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no hepatosplenomegaly  \n- Extremities: No edema, pulses intact  \n- Skin: No rashes, no injection site reactions\n\n---\n\n**Assessment:**  \n28-year-old man with a history of class II obesity and hypertension presents for ongoing pharmacologic weight management. Anthony’s initial BMI warranted pharmacologic intervention (>30 kg/m², above the threshold for medication). Additionally, he has a comorbid condition (hypertension) which further supports the use of adjunctive therapy.\n\nHe has demonstrated significant weight loss (total: 41 lbs; approx. 13% total body weight reduction) over 14 months, improved blood pressure, and no serious adverse effects. He remains adherent to both pharmacologic therapy and lifestyle modifications. He meets all ongoing criteria for continuation of Wegovy:  \n- BMI remains above 30 kg/m²  \n- Meaningful weight reduction achieved and maintained  \n- Comorbidity beneficially impacted  \n- Medication well tolerated, with no signs of pancreatitis or other contraindications  \n- No personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (as previously documented)\n\n---\n\n**Plan:**  \n1. Continue Wegovy 1.7 mg SC weekly. Discussed option to titrate to higher dose if weight loss plateaus or if well-tolerated; currently stable and responding well, so no change this visit.\n2. Continue current antihypertensive therapy (lisinopril).\n3. Reemphasized importance of ongoing calorie-restricted diet and regular physical activity. Patient remains motivated and engaged with nutritionist follow-up.\n4. Advised to monitor for GI symptoms or signs of pancreatitis (severe abdominal pain). Reviewed signs of hypoglycemia, though risk is low without diabetes or insulin therapy.\n5. Discussed long-term commitment to lifestyle modification and pharmacotherapy, as discontinuation may lead to weight regain.\n6. Plan for labs (CMP, lipid panel, HbA1c) prior to next visit, given ongoing medication use and comorbid risk factors.\n7. Schedule follow-up in 3-4 months, with instructions to contact clinic sooner for any significant side effects (persistent vomiting, severe GI upset, allergic reaction, visual changes, or signs of pancreatitis).\n\n**Patient verbalized understanding and agreement with the plan. Medication compliance and weight loss progress noted—will continue to monitor closely.**"
